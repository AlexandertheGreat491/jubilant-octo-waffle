/*The application will allow users who are learning JavaScript
to take a timed quiz on JavaScript that stores high scores, in order 
for users to compare themselves to their peers.*/

// Users will click the start button and a timer will start.
// Users wil be presented with a question and another question.
// When a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the timer.
// When all questions are answered OR the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.
// When the game is over the users can save their initials and score.

// Users will click the "Start Quiz" button, the time will start and the user will be presented with a question.

//Set the date being counted down to
var countDownDate = new Date("May 30, 2022 1:10:30").getTime();

// Update the count down every 1 second
var x = setInterval(function() {

    // Get today's date and time
    var now = new Date().getTime();

    // Find the distance between now and the count down date
    var distance = countDownDate - now;

    // Time calculations for days, hours, minutes and seconds
    var days = Math.floor(distance / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
  var hours = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
  var minutes = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
  var seconds = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);
}, 1000);

// Display the result in the element with the id="timer"

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = days + "d " + hours + "h "
  + minutes + "m " + seconds + "s ";

  // If the count down is finished, write some text
  if (distance < 0) {
